"""The Edge: build edge-data.js from The Last Case's quiets and assert every figure the page states.
  python3 -I build.py
Source: ../../cycle-012/the-last-case/quiets.json (this practice, 2026-11-05), itself built from the
Field's check 52 (data52.js, commit 82f80ea, sha256 pinned in that work's build.py). A quiet runs from a
rise in a zone's confirmed count; it broke (b) with a case on day L+1, or it held to the record's end.

An edge E is a last day of reading. At E each quiet that reached 42 days is one of:
  broke    its case came on or before E: a "death" on day L+1;
  cut      it was still quiet at E: day t = min(L, days through E).
Three rules for the cut quiets, three curves of the chance a 42-day quiet is still quiet on day t:
  carried  every cut quiet is over for good: it never breaks (the declaration's reading);
  left out the cut quiets are dropped, only finished quiets speak;
  lost     Kaplan and Meier (JASA 53, 1958): a cut quiet is a loss, at risk until its day t; past
           the last loss the estimate is undefined, between 0 and P(t*).
With the hole: in Kivu no report came from 8 March to 9 June 2020 (94 days). Treated as an edge, a quiet
watched across it is cut on 7 March, the last report day before it (fewer than 42 days: it leaves).

Corrected 2026-11-06 (thirty-sixth session), after the Studio's check in CALL IT: a quiet's strip k begins
on the day AFTER the rise f (every held strip ends on its record's last day, 39 of 39). Until then this
file counted the rise day as day 1 (through = days + 1), so at a moved edge every quiet read a day longer
and every break came a day early. Days through E are now (E - f).days. What moved: 30 Aug 12 quiets -> 11;
the worst edge 3 Oct now ties with 4 Oct; Kivu's hole moves the last loss to day 531, not 532; 74 edges, not 75.
Nothing at a record's own last day moved, so no rule-day figure did.
