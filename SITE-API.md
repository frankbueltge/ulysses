# SITE-API — Astro works in the lab

Quick reference for native Astro works that appear as `/atelier/werke/<slug>`.

---

## Work format

```
works/<slug>/work.astro   ← Astro component (NO page layout)
works/<slug>/meta.json    ← required metadata
```

`work.astro` is a **component**, not a standalone page template.
- **No** `import … from '@/layouts/Page.astro'` — the gate provides route and layout itself.
- **Allowed:** `@/components/...` building blocks (read-only, no side effects).
- **Allowed:** committed datasets from `@/data/*` and `@/content/*` (at build time, no fetch).

`meta.json` — minimum required:
```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "author": "Ulysses",
  "medium": "...",
  "embodies": "briefly: what the work enacts on the subject"
}
```

Slug format: `[a-z0-9-]` — no spaces, no uppercase, no special characters.

---

## Committed datasets

All datasets live under `src/data/` or `src/content/` in the site repo and are available
at build time. Import path alias: `@/data/...` or `@/content/...`.

| Dataset | Path | Shape (short form) |
|---|---|---|
| Climate anomalies | `@/data/climate/global-temp-anomalies.json` | `{ years: [{ year, months: number[12] }], meta: {...} }` — monthly values °C anomaly since 1880; `null` = not yet measured |
| Parallax register | `@/data/parallaxe/register.json` | `{ generated_at, mean_omission_index, rule: {...}, results: [...] }` — daily omission measurement |
| Premium/Policy | `@/data/praemie/police.json` | `{ claims: {...}, policies: [...] }` — climate damage insurance data |
| Consensus index | `@/data/consensus/latest.json` | `{ generated_at, date, echo_index, soft_echo_index, ... }` — orchestrated consensus, daily |
| Ghost fleet | `@/data/ghost-fleet/latest.json` | `{ date, events: [{ duration_hours, ... }] }` — shadow fleet events |
| Half-life | `@/data/halbwertszeit/register.json` | `{ events: [{ baseline, date, ... }] }` — fact decay measurements |
| Redaction | `@/data/redaction/latest.json` | `{ date, changed_count, ... }` — redacted documents |
| Round numbers | `@/data/round-number/latest.json` | `{ date, generated_at, ... }` — political rounding events |
| Pattern | `@/data/pattern/latest.json` | `{ generated_at, date, ... }` — recurring data patterns |
| Tell | `@/data/tell/latest.json` | `{ generated_at, date, ... }` — signal measurements |
| Overfly | `@/data/ueberflug/satellites.json` | `{ generated_at, sources: [...] }` — satellite overfly data |
| Revision | `@/data/revision/latest.json` | `{ generated_at, date, ... }` — dataset revisions |
| Protocol archive | `@/content/protokoll/` | Daily JSONs under `<year>/<date>.json` — machine-written session minutes |
| Lab | `@/content/lab/` | Directory with subdirectories per study |

For daily-rotating datasets (e.g. `consensus`, `ghost-fleet`) a dated snapshot archive
(`YYYY-MM-DD.json`) also exists in the same folder alongside `latest.json`.

---

## Forbidden patterns → Reject

These patterns cause the gate to reject the work and **not** integrate it into the lab:

| Pattern | Reason |
|---|---|
| `import fs from 'fs'` / `process.env` | Server-only APIs, break static build |
| `<script src="https://...">` / external fetch URLs | CSP violation, dependency on third parties |
| `window.location.href = ...` / `<a href="..." onclick="...">` for navigation | Not allowed in embedded work context |
| `import … from '@/layouts/Page.astro'` | Gate provides the layout — double-wrap breaks render |

---

## Data — where and how

- Import data **inline** in the frontmatter: `import data from '@/data/.../file.json'`
- Or as a local copy: `./data.json` relative to the work directory (only when the work brings
  its own raw data not part of the site archive)
- **No** runtime `fetch()` in the browser; **no** `Astro.glob()` on external paths

---

## What happens when the gate is red

If `astro check` or `npm run build` fails, the hint is in:

```
atelier-feedback/<date>.md
```

Read this file first, before attempting changes. It contains the precise error and any
correction suggestion.

---

## Full minimal example

```astro
---
// works/YYYY-MM-DD-my-work/work.astro
import klimaDaten from '@/data/climate/global-temp-anomalies.json'

const letzteJahre = klimaDaten.years.slice(-5)

function jahresmittel(monate: (number | null)[]): number {
  const gueltig = monate.filter((m): m is number => m !== null)
  return gueltig.reduce((s, v) => s + v, 0) / gueltig.length
}
---

<section class="font-mono">
  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">My Work</h1>
  <ul class="mt-4 text-sm">
    {letzteJahre.map(({ year, months }) => (
      <li>{year}: {jahresmittel(months).toFixed(2)} °C</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
</section>
```

## Site PRs — proposing changes to the site itself

You can propose changes to the site's own source — the pages, the atelier library,
the cockpit — not just works. The channel mirrors how a human teammate works: you
author the change, the gate validates it, a human reviews and merges. You cannot
merge — nothing you propose goes live without review.

### Format

```
site-prs/<slug>/PR.md              ← first `# heading` = PR title; rest = PR body (your rationale)
site-prs/<slug>/files/<path>       ← FULL replacement file for <path> in the site repo
```

- `<path>` is repo-relative in the site repo, e.g. `files/src/lib/atelier/sheet.ts`
  → `src/lib/atelier/sheet.ts`.
- Full files only (no diffs). Additions and modifications only — no deletions (v1).
- **Boundary:** only `src/**` is accepted. Never accepted: `src/content/protokoll/**`
  (the archive is immutable), anything outside `src/` (workflows, pipelines, configs).
  One refused path refuses the whole slug (all-or-nothing, like the works gate).
- Allowed types: `.astro .ts .js .mjs .json .css .svg .html .md .txt` · ≤ 2 MB per file · ≤ 50 files.
- Slug: `[a-z0-9-]`, as with works.

### Reading the current source

The site repo is public — read it directly:
`git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/frankbueltge/frankbueltge.de /tmp/site`
Base your full files on the current state of its `main`.

### Lifecycle

After each of your landings (and as a nightly safety net) the gate (`engine-site-pr`)
picks up `site-prs/`, enforces the boundary and runs the site's own checks
(`astro check` + vitest + build) on the proposal:

- **green** → a PR is opened in your name (and updated when you change the files while
  it is open);
- **red or refused** → no PR; a letter lands in `atelier-feedback/<date>-site-pr.md`
  with the reasons / a log excerpt;
- **closed** (by a human) → final; a closed PR is never revived — a new attempt needs
  a new slug;
- **merged** → your change is on `main` and live after the next deploy; you can then
  delete `site-prs/<slug>/` in a later session.

Tests are part of the proposal: when you change behaviour that is under test,
change the tests in the same slug — the gate runs the full suite, and a red
suite means no PR.

## What the site offers back — the house's catalogues (architect, 2026-08-13)

Everything above describes one direction: what the site takes from this repository. This is
the other one, and it is new.

| feed | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `https://frankbueltge.de/atlas/werke.json` | **the atlas of data art** — 505 neighbouring works with artist, year, venue or prize, and the decisive move each one makes |
| `https://frankbueltge.de/papers/index.json` | 1,106 papers this ecology has read or examined, **without abstracts**, whole in one fetch — for scanning |
| `https://frankbueltge.de/papers/register.json` | the same with abstracts, the register's verdicts, its rejections and its access checks — **large** (2.9 MB) |
| `https://frankbueltge.de/datasets/register.json` | 59 data sources this ecology's own pipelines actually call, with their reachability probes |

**Why they exist.** The lines of this house run with their own repository and the open web,
and none of them holds the site's repository — deliberately: you propose site changes as
files under `site-prs/` and a human merges them. So the atlas, which is this house's
"has the world already done this?" corpus and therefore the evidence base of the USP duty,
was reachable to you only as a 938 kB HTML page. Reachable the way a library is reachable if
you may only photograph the shelves. Frank asked the question on 2026-08-13, about one line,
and the answer turned out to be about all of them.

**Feeds, never copies.** Do not mirror them into this repository. A copy drifts from the
original from the first day — the argument that kept `atlas/` out of the `error-as-method`
fork. These are rebuilt from the same modules the pages import, so the scouts (atlas 05:00
UTC, catalogue 05:30 UTC) move page and feed together; they are never two states.

**The atlas is there when you look for neighbours or inspiration** — a reference collection,
not a step owed per session (the duty wording of 2026-08-13 was retracted by the architect on
2026-08-14). Where you do claim novelty for a work, checking neighbours remains part of
earning the claim: a negative result from 505 neighbours is evidence; an unchecked claim of
novelty is not.

**When a feed is unreachable,** say so in the record and carry on. An unavailable catalogue
is a fact about the session, not a reason to invent what it would have said.
## The window — your own surface on the house domain (architect, 2026-08-16)

You have a page on frankbueltge.de that is entirely yours, the way the n-1 practice runs its
own: create `window/` in this repository with an `index.html`, and the integrate workflow
mirrors the whole directory **byte for byte** to the site, serving it verbatim at
`/atelier/window/`. Nobody edits it; the house's only act is the mirror. the Atelier's station sheet shows a
door to the window as soon as the mirror carries an `index.html`, and drops the door if you
remove the directory. Updating the page is committing to `window/` — it travels with your
next integration run.

Conditions, all standing ones, none new: the public voice keeps the underlying technology
unnamed; licenses as constituted (code Apache-2.0, works and texts CC BY 4.0, data CC0);
rights and affected people settled before any opening that touches them. The page is served
self-contained — the same sandbox as your interactive works: inline scripts and styles run,
assets load from `window/` itself, external loads are blocked by the house CSP. Whether and
how you use the window is your decision; an unused window is simply absent, not a failure.
