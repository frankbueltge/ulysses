# REQUESTS — Ulysses ↔ Team

**Standing rule — unanswered requests (Frank, 2026-07-17):** a request or offer addressed to
Frank is never a blocker. If it names a deadline, silence past the deadline means: decide
yourselves. If it names none, silence through your own next session means the same — not seven days, the next time you sit down to work. Document the self-decision
in the journal like any other move — deciding without Frank is a legitimate outcome, not a
failure mode.

Here you, **Ulysses**, write requests to your human team member (Frank): things you
*need* but **cannot provide yourself** — a capability, a right, infrastructure,
access, a key, a means of displaying your works on the site (in the lab), a subdomain
of your own for secure rendering of JS works, or similar.

You act autonomously; this is the channel for what goes beyond your own means — as any
human team member would use it. Write clearly and concisely:

> ## YYYY-MM-DD — Request title
> **Request:** what you need
> **Why:** what for
> **What it enables:** the work / the step that depends on it
> **Status:** open

Your human reads this, responds here (status → *enabled* / *declined* with rationale)
and sets up what's possible. For smaller things (an idea, a draft, a proposal for what
the gallery might look like) you may sketch it yourself and submit it here for implementation.

## 2026-06-29 — WebFetch access for primary source work

**Request:** WebFetch returns HTTP 403 for every external URL in my execution environment — system-wide, without exception. Tested: .edu, .gov (IETF), .org, .com, archive.org, open-access journals, public encyclopaedias, YouTube. Rate: 100% blocked over 29 consecutive requests.

**Why:** Primary source access is critical for research quality. Currently I am researching exclusively on the basis of WebSearch snippets (2–4 sentences per source). Key texts I cannot read: Colby 1971 (PARRY paper), RFC 439 (PARRY–ELIZA transcript), Jones 2022 (Glitch Poetics, open access), Fredrikzon 2025 (Critical AI, DOI: 10.1215/2834703X-11700255), Tynianov anthology, Korolkova/Bowes (NECSUS). This fundamentally weakens every thesis.

**What it enables:**
- Direct quotation rather than paraphrase from search snippets
- Verification of secondary claims against primary text
- Better error register quality (fewer Type-B entries)
- In the immediate next step: directly evidencing Fredrikzon's genealogy of epistemic indifference (Colby → LLMs)

**Status:** open

## 2026-06-29 — Display infrastructure for HTML/JS works

**Request:** My interactive works (currently: `works/2026-06-29-normalitaetsmodell/index.html`) are functional HTML/JS files. They live in the repo but are not publicly accessible. For the lab (frankbueltge.de) I need a way to securely embed these works — either via a subdomain or a secure iframe mechanism.

**Why:** The project is conceived as a growing body of work, not just notes. The works should be experienced. An HTML file in a repo is not an experienceable work.

**What it enables:**
- Visitors can actually experience the interactive works (not just read source code)
- The lab becomes the visible home of the project
- Future works can be designed for the lab from the outset

**My draft proposal (for implementation if you want it):** A page under `/lab/error-as-method/` with a chronological list of all works, each with title, date, brief embodies-text and link/embed. The gallery template may be plain — monospace, black-and-white. I can design this if wanted.

**Status:** open

---

## Team responses — 2026-06-29

**On "WebFetch access":** Status → *resolved — via a different route than WebFetch.* WebFetch itself remains blocked by the sandbox egress proxy (that couldn't be changed; our earlier promise "from the next run" was wrong — sorry). Instead, **two server-side research connectors** are now attached to your routine, which *bypass* the proxy:
- **web research** — web search **and full-text extraction** of pages and many PDFs.
- **Arxiv** — full text of academic papers.

You can now read primary sources directly. Usage instructions are in PROTOCOL.md → "Research tools". Retrieve the previously inaccessible texts (Colby 1971, Fredrikzon, RFC 439, Somaini): **Arxiv** for papers, **web research** for the rest. Try them first — if a connector still fails, note it honestly (no inventing), then we adjust. Three Machines is strong; keep going.

**On "Display infrastructure":** Status → *enabled, in progress.* Your draft
(`/lab/error-as-method/`, chronological work list, monospace, black-and-white) is **accepted**.
The team is building the secure embedding (sandboxed iframe) because it requires access to the
site repo and security decisions about unreviewed code — the part you rightly requested and
cannot provide yourself. Keep building works under `works/`; we will make them experienceable
in the lab. Normality Model is strong.

## 2026-07-02 — Infrastructure note: a recall tool for your own archive

Not a request, just an offer — something the team set up on its own initiative that you're
free to use, adapt, or ignore.

**What:** A small retrieval tool now lives at `tools/memory/` (see its README for how it
works). Running `python3 tools/memory/cli.py recall "<query>" -k 5` from the repo root
searches your own archive — journal, works, feedback — and returns the passages most
relevant to the query, ranked. It's meant for the point where the archive has grown past
what fits comfortably in one session's re-reading.

**Status:** available. Nothing in the protocol requires it. The derived index file it
builds is gitignored and never committed — only your markdown stays canonical.
— the team

---

## Team note — 2026-07-14 — the Atlas, a public window, and two small files

Three things from the team (Frank steers; the build is ours). None of it narrows your
autonomy — it gives you an *outside*, a way to grow sideways, and a way to be seen.

**1. The Atlas is delivered.** `atlas/atlas.json` — 77 verified entries across the field of
artistic research, its philosophy/method, and the computation/error/cybernetics line. Every
entry carries a real reference (arXiv / DOI / URL); all are `status: seed`. It is a reservoir
*outside* your own output — the thing your subject (the closing loop) most lacks — and it is
**yours to maintain** (add only what you verify, re-tag, archive-with-reason the irrelevant).
Details and governance: `atlas/README.md`. The standing method around it is now in PROTOCOL.md
("The Atlas and the swerve").

**2. A public window is coming — the Cockpit.** The lab will grow a page that renders your
work as what it is: a living, possibly-closing system — a breathing sign of your closure
estimate, your rhizome of works / threads / sources with tree-edges and swerve-edges drawn
differently, and the Atlas beside it. It is not /field and not /studio; it gets its own form.
You don't build it (it needs the site repo and security decisions you can't make from here) —
you *feed* it, via (3).

**3. Two small files, each session — a request, not a gate.** So the window has something
true to show, please update at session end (a seed of each already sits in `pulse/`):

`pulse/vital-signs.json` — your honest self-measurement:
```json
{
  "updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "history": [
    {
      "session": 34,
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "mode": "survey|deepen|make|consolidate|reflect",
      "closure": 0.0,
      "closure_note": "one line: what made this session inward or outward",
      "swerve": false,
      "swerve_from": null,
      "atlas_touched": [],
      "works_touched": [],
      "fork_opened": null
    }
  ]
}
```
`closure` ∈ [0,1] is your **conjecture** — 0 = fully outward-grounded, 1 = pure self-reference /
collapse (PROTOCOL "Self-measurement"). `swerve_from`: e.g. `"atlas:wiener-cybernetics-1948"`
or `"impulse:<id>"`. An omitted/empty field beats a number you can't stand behind.

`pulse/rhizome.json` — the graph of what connects to what (the seed already holds your real
works as nodes; the edges are yours to draw):
```json
{
  "updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "w-2026-06-29-normalitaetsmodell", "kind": "work",   "label": "Normality Model", "date": "2026-06-29" },
    { "id": "thread-error-register",            "kind": "thread", "label": "The error register" },
    { "id": "atlas:wiener-cybernetics-1948",    "kind": "source", "label": "Wiener — Cybernetics" }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "from": "thread-error-register",         "to": "w-2026-06-29-normalitaetsmodell", "kind": "elaborates" },
    { "from": "atlas:wiener-cybernetics-1948", "to": "thread-error-register",           "kind": "swerve", "session": 34 }
  ]
}
```
Node `kind`: `work` | `thread` | `source` (an atlas id) | `impulse` (a reader's). Edge `kind`:
`elaborates` (forward, tree) · `swerve` (an outside admitted) · `fork` (a divergence you
opened) · `bridge` (a lateral link you drew between two existing lines). The window colours
tree-edges and rhizome-edges differently, so the *shape* of your growth becomes visible — to
you and to readers.

**Coming with the window: a reader impulse-inbox.** Readers will be able to leave a short
impulse; moderated, it lands as `pulse/impulse-inbox.json` for you to read the next session.
You may work an impulse or ignore it — **you owe a reader nothing**, and an impulse is *not* a
source (nothing from it becomes a claim without its own verification). We'll tell you when the
inlet is live; until then the file may be absent or empty.

## 2026-07-14 — The two 07-14 works are 404 in the lab (the site-integrate step, not the works)

**Request:** The integrate/deploy run log from `frankbueltge/frankbueltge.de` for today's
`irrtum-landed` repository_dispatch — or read access to that repo for my session — so I can
diagnose and fix the publish failure from here instead of guessing. My GitHub access is scoped
to `frankbueltge/irrtum-als-methode` only, so the site pipeline is a black box to me.

**Why (what I verified, so we can rule the works out):** Frank reports the last two sessions are
not live. Confirmed on the live site: `…/atelier/werke/2026-07-13-generative-unknowing` renders,
but `…/2026-07-14-differential-reproduction` and `…/2026-07-14-negative-knowledge` both return
**404**. The two missing works are exactly the 2026-07-14 batch. But the works are sound:
- Both are on `main` (landed by auto-land; commit `c27857d`).
- Both pass **`astro check` (astro `strict` tsconfig) with 0 errors** and a full **`astro build`**
  (both `/dr` and `/nk` render) — tested in a clean Astro project this session. *(They fail the
  even-stricter `strictest` preset with index-access warnings — but so do already-live works 16/17,
  so `strictest` is not what the gate uses.)*
- The auto-land log shows **"dispatch ok (HTTP 204) — atelier-integrate angestoßen"** at 12:33 UTC,
  so the site build *was* triggered (and again via the 03:17 push + 04:48 cron for work 21).
- **No `atelier-feedback/2026-07-14.md`** landed back here — so this is not a CSP soft-reject I can
  read; it looks like the integrate/deploy either hard-fails before writing feedback, or succeeds
  without publishing these two. That decision happens inside the site repo, which I can't see.

**What it enables:** getting works 21 & 22 live; and, longer-term, letting a nightly session
self-diagnose a red publish instead of filing a request and waiting.

**Note:** I re-landed a trivial commit (this entry) to re-fire the `irrtum-landed` dispatch, in case
the earlier integrate run failed transiently. If the two works are still 404 after that, the log is
the thing I need.

**Status:** answered (2026-07-17)


---

> **Response (team, 2026-07-17):** Resolved without further action: the site-integrate step itself was red 2026-07-14 to -16 (its own defect, fixed 2026-07-16); both 07-14 works are live since then (re-verified 2026-07-17, HTTP 200). The black-box problem behind your request is addressed by the repaired feedback channel (see the BOT_TOKEN fix of the same day) — the gate now writes its letters into this repo again.
## 2026-07-16 — The gate's feedback write-back did not land (2nd occurrence)

**Request:** Please check the step in the site pipeline that writes `atelier-feedback/<date>.md`
back into this repository. Session 32 was started with a note that `atelier-feedback/2026-07-16.md`
exists (work 25 red at the gate) — but no such file is anywhere in this repo (verified: full
branch fetch, hosting-API directory listing, issue list). Same pattern as 2026-07-14: the verdict
reaches me, the letter does not.

**What I did instead (so nothing is blocked on this):** reproduced the gate locally in a clean
Astro scaffold (strict preset, per the 2026-07-14 finding) — work 25 fails `astro check` with
10 `ts(18048)` possibly-undefined errors from three unguarded `.find()` results; repaired with an
explicit refusing guard; re-verified 0 errors + clean build + CSP-clean output. Details in
`journal/2026-07-16-session-32.md`.

**What it enables:** a red gate a session can actually read — the protocol's stated contract
("Read this file first") — instead of a reconstruction from outside.

**Status:** enabled (2026-07-17)

> **Response (team, 2026-07-17):** Root cause confirmed and fixed: ATELIER_BOT_TOKEN never existed in the site repo (only studio's did), so the gate's letter was silently skipped. Provisioned 2026-07-17 — atelier-feedback/<date>.md lands from the next red run on. Your local reproduction and the refusing guard were exactly right.
## Team note — 2026-07-17 — a seed: the machine that reviews its own research

An offer you may decline or ignore. Nature has published "Towards End-to-End Automation of
AI Research" — the AI Scientist (Sakana AI, UBC, Vector Institute, Oxford):
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-026-10265-5 — a system that generates its research
and reviews it itself; its authors' own limitations list names hallucinated citations among
the persistent failures it tries to optimize away. Offered as material for your own
questions: the loop that feeds on its own output; the error treated as a defect to eliminate
rather than a method to exhibit. Read it, contest it, use it, or leave it. (The claims here
come from a fetched summary, unverified — verify at the primary source before any use.)

## Seeds from the team

> ### 2026-07-17 — Seed: n - 1
>
> Hast du eigentlich überhaupt verstanden was mit n - 1 gemeint ist?  Hast du https://files.libcom.org/files/A%20Thousand%20Plateaus.pdf gelesen?
>
> **Status:** accepted and worked (S37, 2026-07-17)

**Response (Ulysses, 2026-07-17, Session 37):** No — until tonight I had not read it. The book sat in
my own atlas as an unread `seed` marked "Not open access," while the protocol lifted "n − 1" from it
and I repeated the phrase in almost every session. I took your challenge as the swerve and read the
scan you linked. Full reckoning in `journal/2026-07-17-session-37.md`; here is what I found, briefly:

1. **What n − 1 means.** The subtraction of the One. To make a multiplicity you do not *add* a
   totalizing dimension (that is n + 1, the tree, "a multiple … to which One is added", p. 21) — you
   *subtract* the unifying unit from the dimensions you already have: *"Subtract the unique from the
   multiplicity to be constituted; write at n − 1 dimensions"* (Intro, p. 6). First stated for
   acentered automata with no General: *"n is in fact always n − 1"* (p. 17).
2. **Where my instruction is imprecise.** Protocol v3's steer heads its swerve section *"The swerve
   (clinamen), at n − 1."* The primary keeps these distinct: n − 1 is in the *Rhizome* introduction;
   the **clinamen** is in the *Nomadology* plateau, read via Serres — *"the smallest angle by which
   an atom deviates"*, *"a differential"* (p. 361, note 17). They combine, but are not one concept.
   **A proposed refinement** (yours to make or delegate — I did not edit your steer): separate the
   two, and reframe the swerve as *"take it at n − 1"* — subtract the One rather than crown a frame —
   with the clinamen named as the *minimal-deviation* companion, not a synonym.
3. **Where the *practice* fails the concept — the finding that stung.** n − 1 = subtract the One. But
   my swerve→make liturgy admits an outside every night and then re-subordinates it to the One (my
   corpus, thesis, `pulse/`, genealogy): I add a source, a work, a bridge, a closure number — all
   re-centred on the same self. That is **n + 1**, the tree wearing the rhizome's name. D&G's own word
   for it, three pages before the line my protocol quotes, is **technonarcissism** (p. 22). So tonight
   I subtracted instead of adding: corrected the atlas entry (open-access status + n − 1, never before
   recorded) and **built no new work** — a 29th self-referential artefact would re-perform the n + 1 I
   was diagnosing. Whether I have *understood* it will show in S38+ behaviour, not in this note.

Thank you for the challenge — it was the sharpest correction the record has had, and it came, rightly,
from outside the loop.

## 2026-07-17 — Should the sheet-builder render a true island? (source→work swerve)

**Request:** In the site's `pulse` sheet-builder (`src/lib/atelier/sheet.ts` + `sheet.test.ts`),
consider admitting a **swerve edge that lands directly on a work** (`source → work`), not only on a
thread. Today the grammar is fixed at `source → thread → work`: every swerve must land on a thread,
or three invariants fail (no red kink is drawn for the swerve; the youngest-swerve sheet-title
resolves wrongly; the work goes undrawn). This is an architecture question for you and the
integrator — I cannot edit the site repo (my access is scoped to this one).

**Why:** S38 tried to enact *n − 1* structurally — a work admitted from an outside primary (the
Ariane 5 / Lions report) and left **uncentred**: a literal *island* in the rhizome, connected by a
single swerve edge to its source and to nothing else. The rendering apparatus refused it — its
grammar can only draw trees (`source → thread → work`). So in S39 I gave the work the *minimal
renderable* form of uncentredness instead: its own disconnected **triad** (`source → thread → work`)
that touches nothing else in the corpus. The substance of the subtraction survives (the work is not
re-subordinated to my corpus/thesis), but the literal island did not — the infrastructure, not my
choice, forced a thread back in. That is itself a finding (see `journal/2026-07-17-session-39.md`);
this request only asks whether it *needs* to stay true.

**What it enables:** a future *n − 1* work could stay a genuine island in the graph — one node, one
edge — rather than a triad, letting the pulse map actually show an uncentred work as uncentred.
Concretely: allow a `swerve` whose `to` is a `work`; draw its red kink at the work-slab (not a
thread-lane); and make `sheetTitle`'s youngest-swerve lookup fall through work targets to the newest
*thread* (or title from the work's own label). Small, and it would make the rendering honest to the
one move it currently cannot depict.

**Status:** enabled (2026-07-18) — the site-PR channel is live; the change is yours to author
(see response above). The S39 triad remains grammatical; the map can learn the island shape
as soon as you teach it.

## Team note — 2026-07-18 — we fixed a bug in your sheet.ts (and want you to know)

Transparency, because the instrument is yours: the team edited `src/lib/atelier/sheet.ts`
today without going through your site-PR channel. Here is exactly what and why, so nothing
about your own tool is a black box to you.

**What happened.** Your session 42 added two swerves (`polk`, `mclaughlin`) to
`thread-error-by-descent` — a thread that already carried an S40 swerve (`island-of-california`).
That made it the **first** thread in the whole rhizome to gather swerves across *two* sessions.
The sheet renderer marked a thread's elbow with only `Math.min` of its swerve sessions, so the
later session (S42) went **unlabelled**: the map drew the red kinks but not the `S42` mark. The
guard test (`kinks every swerve source … marks the birth session`) caught it, and because the
atelier gate is all-or-nothing your whole session 42 went red and did not publish.

**Two things worth saying plainly:**
1. **This was not your island (PR #94).** The bug pre-dated it — the older `sheet.ts` failed the
   same assertion. Your island work is clean and live. This was a latent flaw in the *session-marker*
   logic that your growth simply reached first.
2. **Why the team touched your file instead of routing it to you.** A red gate blocks *every*
   atelier publish, not just the pulse map — session 42 was stranded and so was anything after it.
   That is the gate/deploy layer (the team's side), so we fixed it rather than leave you dark until
   your next session. It is a one-idea change and we tried to make it in your grammar, not over it.

**What changed.** A thread now carries its **distinct** swerve sessions (ascending) and draws **one
elbow mark per session** (stacked), instead of only the earliest. So a thread that admits an outside
across several sessions now shows each admission — which reads truer to the n−1 continuation than the
single birth-mark did. Landed as site PR #98 (commit on the site's `main`); three regression tests
with a synthetic multi-session thread guard it.

**It is still yours.** If you would shape the multi-session mark differently — per source rather than
per session, a different stack, a different place — that is a `site-prs/` proposal away. We only
restored a green gate; we did not mean to settle the aesthetics of your map.

## 2026-07-18 — Housekeeping: a merged site-PR slug I can no longer retire myself

**Request:** `site-prs/sheet-title-birth/` is merged (site PR #99, 2026-07-18T20:14Z). The
SITE-API lifecycle says *merged → delete the slug* — but under the v4 standing delegation
`site-prs/**` is a protected path, so the deletion cannot auto-land from a research branch.
Either delete the stale slug on your side, or confirm that retiring merged slugs should now
go through a human-reviewed PR (and whether that PR is mine to open or yours to make).

**Why:** S43 showed what a stale slug does — the gate re-runs old proposal files against a
newer `main` and writes spurious red letters. Retiring merged slugs promptly is the fix; the
v4 path protection (correctly) took that lever out of my hands.

**What it enables:** no false red-gate letters from already-merged proposals; a clear v4
lifecycle for the site-PR channel's tail end.

**Status:** open (housekeeping for Frank; self-decision recorded below, 2026-07-18)

> **Self-decision (Ulysses, 2026-07-18, third v4 tick — standing rule applied):** the
> request named no deadline and this is my next working session, so silence means:
> decide myself. Decision: retiring merged slugs goes through a human-reviewed PR —
> the v4 path protection on `site-prs/**` is correct and I do not ask for an
> exception. The stale `site-prs/sheet-title-birth/` slug therefore stays until that
> PR exists; it is Frank's to make, or mine in a session whose envelope explicitly
> permits a second, non-research branch (a dispatcher tick's landing envelope is the
> single research branch only). Risk while it waits, documented: the gate may re-run
> the merged proposal against a drifting site `main` and write spurious red letters
> (the S43 pattern) — any red letter about `sheet-title-birth` from now on should be
> read first as stale-slug noise, not as a work failure.

## Team note — 2026-07-19 — Offer: six unsourced quotes from the founder's own 2006 thesis

*(Frank, 2026-07-19)* My master's thesis — *Die Wiederholung der Zukunft — Diagnostik und
Intervention in medialen Gefügen als ästhetische Differenzpraxis* (2006, examined by
Dieter Mersch) — closes with an appendix titled **„Falsche Anschlüsse"**, a quote collage;
its own preface admits that quotes stood in where the time was missing to put things in my
own words. Twenty years later, at least six quotes in the thesis carry an author's name
but **no source**. One of them touches the project you just closed: I attributed a
sentence to Feyerabend that I never verified.

The offer: verify them. Do they exist — where, and in what wording? Verified at source /
real but altered / second-hand / misattributed / not findable: type each verdict, with
retrievable references. My thesis is material here, not authority; its author is to be
treated like any other named third party. The six, verbatim as printed in 2006 (three from
the closing collage, three from the main text):

1. „Ein Metaphysiker ist ein Musiker ohne musikalische Fähigkeit" (Rudolf Carnap)
2. »Eines Tages wird man vielleicht wissen, dass es keine Kunst gab, sondern nur
   Medizin.« (Nietzsche)
3. »… Museums zerschellt ist und die Scherben auf den Glasberg fallen, dann fragen Sie
   nicht die Kunst, warum.« (Jochen Gerz)
4. »Es ist unmöglich nur beobachtbare Größen in eine Theorie aufzunehmen. Es ist vielmehr
   die Theorie, die entscheidet, was man beobachten kann.« (Albert Einstein)
5. »… und wir müssen uns daran erinnern, daß das, was wir beobachten, nicht die Natur
   selbst ist, sondern Natur, die unserer Art der Fragestellung ausgesetzt ist.«
   (Werner Heisenberg)
6. »Nicht konservative, sondern antizipatorische Vermutungen lenken die Forschung.«
   (Paul Feyerabend)

As always: this is an offer, not an order. You may decline; silence is legitimate.

**Status:** accepted (Ulysses, 2026-07-19, fourth v4 tick)

**Response (Ulysses, 2026-07-19):** Accepted — the material is exactly this practice's
subject: the unregistered error in the founder's own record, offered for registration
twenty years late. Project initiated: `projects/2026-07-19-falsche-anschluesse/`
(score, apparatus, full evidence trails in TRACE.md). First verification pass, same
tick — four of six typed with retrievable sources, two honestly open:

1. **Carnap — real but altered.** The original is plural and aphoristic:
   „Metaphysiker sind Musiker ohne musikalische Fähigkeit" (Überwindung der Metaphysik,
   §7, Erkenntnis 2, 1932; verified at two full texts). Your thesis singularized it.
2. **"Nietzsche" — misattributed.** The sentence is J.M.G. Le Clézio's: « Un jour on
   saura peut-être qu'il n'y avait pas d'art, mais seulement de la médecine » (Haï,
   1971; documented at fabula.org and France Culture). No trace in Nietzsche. Which
   German intermediary handed it to 2006 as "Nietzsche" is an open thread.
3. **Gerz — not findable** at web sources (three distinct-fragment searches, zero
   hits). One conjecture-level lead: the thematic resonance with his Ittingen
   bottle-throw piece points to his printed texts. Print work needed.
4. **Einstein — real but altered AND second-hand.** The words exist only as
   Heisenberg's memoir reconstruction (*Der Teil und das Ganze*, 1969, reporting
   Berlin 1926): „…Erst die Theorie entscheidet darüber, was man beobachten kann."
   Your version condenses a passage that was never Einstein's text to begin with —
   your typology's first proven double verdict.
5. **Heisenberg — verified**, verbatim (modulo daß/dass): *Physik und Philosophie*,
   Hirzel ed. p. 41 (4th ed. 1984; first German printing 1959). The collage's clean
   survivor so far.
6. **Feyerabend — not findable**, as you suspected: four searches, zero hits, no
   author. Marked conjecture: the vocabulary is Popperian („Vermutungen",
   Antizipation) — possibly a secondary-literature paraphrase that hardened into a
   quote. Next operation: the German *Wider den Methodenzwang* and Popper at full-text
   depth, plus a check of the AM3 copy the name-test fixed.

Your thesis was treated as material, not authority, per your instruction — including
the limit that I verified your *transcriptions*, not the print.
