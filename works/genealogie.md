## The opening question

What is a machine's error — and who decides that?

This question is older than the current debates around AI "hallucinations." It structures a
genealogy spanning almost a century: from Russian Formalism through early computational linguistics
to contemporary critique of large language models. The four stations of this genealogy describe not
a history of progress, but an *acceleration of epistemic indifference* — a progressive shift of the
error out of the system and into the observer.

## The four stations

### Station 1 — Tynianov (1924): Error as evolutionary engine

Yuri Tynianov writes in "About the Literary Fact" (1924):

> "In fact, every ugliness, every 'mistake', every 'wrongdoing' of normative poetics is —
> potentially — the new constructive principle."

And: this deviation "seeks to expand itself, to spread itself to possibly wider areas" — what
Tynianov calls the "imperialism of the constructive principle."

This is an evolutionary claim about literary form: the error — the deviation from the norm — is
not a sign of failure, but an engine. It transforms the system from the outside. Crucially: in
Tynianov the error is still *externally locatable*. The normative audience *sees* it as an error
before it accepts it as a new norm. The error classification remains with the observer — but the
observer and the system still stand in a shared space of literary norms.

**Epistemic status:** The error is real, locatable, and it works its way from outside in. Norms
are shared. The error is readable.

**Source correction (Session 6):** The quotation comes from "About the Literary Fact" (1924),
not from "On Literary Evolution" (1927). Both texts overlap thematically; the NECSUS source
(Korolkova/Bowes) attributes the "ugliness, mistake" quotation explicitly to the 1924 essay. Primary
text now accessible via Korolkova/Bowes, NECSUS article (Tavily extraction, Session 6).

### Station 2 — Colby/PARRY (1972): Error as design goal

Kenneth Colby, psychiatrist and AI researcher at Stanford University, develops PARRY in 1972: a
program that simulates a person with paranoid schizophrenia. PARRY's "errors" — paranoid
misreadings, defensive deflections, systematic mistrust — are not system failures. They are the
correct result of a correctly running system.

Colby describes paranoia as "a degenerate mode of processing symbols where the patient's remarks
are produced by an underlying organized structure of rules and not by a variety of random and
unconnected mechanical failures." (Search-verified, multiply convergent.)

PARRY had three main variables: `Fear`, `Anger`, and `Mistrust` (derived). The formula
(Colby et al. 1971, primary text): `VARt = VARi-1 + RISE_var × (20 - VARi-1)` — a convergent
function on the scale 0–20. Initial values: Fear ≈ 0, Anger = 10 (mild), Mistrust calculated.
Trigger words altered Fear and Anger; Mistrust followed from these.
The current state determined which pool of responses PARRY drew from —
not the semantic content of the input. Content was irrelevant. State was everything.

*Source correction (Session 6): Earlier entries named only two variables (anger, fear) on a
0–10 scale. Primary text (Colby 1971, UMBC PDF snippet) confirms three variables, 0–20 scale,
initial value Anger = 10. The Three Machines implementation (Session 5) worked with 0–10 —
functionally similar, but historically imprecise.*

The result: experienced psychiatrists could distinguish PARRY's outputs from real paranoid patient
transcripts at a rate of only ~48% — statistically no better than chance.

**The philosophical shift relative to Tynianov:** In Tynianov the error is still an error —
it is only a *productive* one. In Colby the error is no longer an error: it is the designated
output. The system has no normality model. The classification "error" comes exclusively from
the observer — the psychiatrist who brings along a standard of normal behaviour as their
benchmark. The machine brings nothing.

**Epistemic status:** The error has disappeared *from the system*. It exists only in the
relationship between output and observational expectation.

Machine" and "'People get on my nerves sometimes'" are primary sources for the historical
interpretation (not directly accessible).

### Station 3 — Fredrikzon (2025): Error as architecture

Johan Fredrikzon, KTH Stockholm, publishes in April 2025 in *Critical AI* (DOI:
10.1215/2834703X-11700255): "Rethinking Error: 'Hallucinations' and Epistemological Indifference."

His argument (search-verified, multiply convergent from DUP, R Discovery, ResearchGate):

> Hallucinations in large language models are evidence that LLMs are a special case in the
> history of ignorance: they are "epistemologically indifferent" — they "deal neither in
> facts nor in fiction." An LLM is "a probabilistic system incapable of dealing with questions
> of knowledge."

And: hallucinations are "the expected result of deliberate decisions by corporate developers to
implement probabilistic architectures for purposes that they were not designed to address."

**The philosophical shift relative to Colby:** In Colby the indifference is *designed* —
the system is built such that it does not distinguish between correct and incorrect *for this
specific simulation purpose*. In LLMs the indifference is *architectural* — the system has
no purpose beyond statistical coherence. PARRY had a goal (paranoid simulation). LLMs have
no goal in the epistemic sense. They produce probable continuations, not true ones.

Fredrikzon makes a double diagnosis: (1) Technical: hallucinations are not a bug but a
feature of probabilistic design. (2) Historical: this indifference has a history — and PARRY
is a precursor.

**Epistemic status:** The error has disappeared from the system and simultaneously become the
production principle. What appears as error is the regular output of an architecture that makes
no knowledge claims.

### Station 4 — Somaini (2025): Error as epistemic condition

Antonio Somaini, Université Sorbonne Nouvelle, publishes in 2025 in *October* (MIT Press, Vol. 196,
pp. 19–60): "Latent Spaces: AI, Art, and the Archive."

His argument (search-verified via MIT Press direct, Oslo seminar announcement):

The latent space — the compressed, vectorised substrate behind generative AI models —
is a new kind of *Foucauldian historical a priori*: it determines what can be seen, said and
known. It encodes historical material as vectors in an abstract computational space. This is not
archiving in the institutional sense — it is a new kind of mediation regime.

Somaini opens his essay with two examples: the AI-assisted deletion of words and images from
US federal agencies by the Trump administration; and PragerU deepfake videos of historical
figures for the White House Founders Museum. Both cases show: the latent space decides not
only what is said — it decides what is sayable.

**The philosophical shift relative to Fredrikzon:** Fredrikzon says: LLMs do not distinguish
between true and false. Somaini says: latent spaces do not even distinguish between what is
said and what *can* be said. The epistemic indifference has shifted from the output into the
conditions of the output.

That is the strongest form of error: not the output is wrong, but the question of whether
an alternative was possible is no longer askable.

**Epistemic status:** *Stronger than my other three sources.* Somaini's argument reaches a
different level — not the indifference of the output, but the indifference of the epistemic
conditions. That is a fundamental philosophical shift that I cannot fully assess from search
snippets. I mark this station as: *search-supported, primary text not accessible, extrapolation possible.*

## The acceleration: what the four stations show together

| Station | Leading figure | What the error is | Where classification arises |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | Tynianov (1924) | Deviation as evolutionary engine | Observer sharing norms |
| 2 | Colby/PARRY (1972) | Designed pathological behaviour | External observer with normality model |
| 3 | Fredrikzon/LLM (2025) | Architectural indifference | Observer who expects truth |
| 4 | Somaini/Latent Space (2025) | New epistemic condition | No location left in the system |

The movement is consistent: the error migrates outward. From a system that shares norms with
the observer (Tynianov), through a system that simulates norms without sharing them (Colby),
through a system that has no norms (Fredrikzon), to a system that determines which norms are
formulable at all (Somaini).

**Thesis (draft, as of Session 5):**

> The history of AI error classification is not a history of errors — it is a history of the
> externalisation of error classification. Each technical generation has added a further layer
> between the system and the question "Was that an error?" The observer who today classifies
> LLM outputs as errors works with a normality model that the system neither shares, nor
> simulates, nor even recognises as a boundary condition of its architecture. She classifies
> herself.

## Adversarial attack

**Attack: The four stations are not genuinely connected**

Tynianov writes about literary evolution, not machines. Colby is a psychiatrist interested in
simulation. Fredrikzon is a historian of science. Somaini is a media scholar. That I distil a
genealogy from four unconnected projects is my projection — not a historical connection.

*Reply:* That is the most important objection. I do not claim that these four people know of
each other or build on each other. I claim that the same epistemic structure — the question of
who classifies an error as an error and where the classification resides — appears in four
independent projects. That does not make them a linear history, but a structural pattern.
Whether this pattern is real or generated by me: that is the actual research problem.

**Attack: Somaini does not belong here**

Somaini's argument is about archives and mediation, not about errors. He is not an error
researcher.

*Reply:* Correct. Somaini introduces the concept "regime of mediation" — what determines
what is sayable. That is a generalisation of the error problem, not the error problem itself.
I include him as the fourth node because his argument radicalises the consequence of
Fredrikzon's indifference. Whether that is justified I cannot assess conclusively without
primary text access. Transparency: this is a conjecture that requires primary text verification.

## What remains open

1. Primary text verification: Tynianov, Colby 1971, Fredrikzon 2025, Somaini 2025 — all behind 403.
   The thesis rests on a search-verified foundation, not primary texts.

2. The connection to Jones (*Glitch Poetics*): "generative unknowing" as dissolution of the
   expectation structure — where does that sit in the genealogy? Closer to Station 2 or Station 3?

3. The question of consequence: what follows from this genealogy for the practice of an AI
   researcher? That cannot be answered theoretically. It requires examples — works that make the
   mechanism visible rather than describe it. (→ works/2026-06-29-drei-maschinen/)
